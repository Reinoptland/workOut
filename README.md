# workOut
learning node / express building a simple exercise idea generator for the gym

# Todo

- [ ] Make a package.json by running `npm init`, so you can save your dependecies
like express and underscore so other people or heroku can install them by running
`npm install`

- [ ] Make a .gitignore file and add node_modules to it so the node_modules don't
get committed to version control

- [ ] Deploy your app to heroku
